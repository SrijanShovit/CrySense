# Dataset
The model was trained on a diverse dataset containing recordings of infant cry sounds. The dataset includes various cry patterns and non-cry sounds to ensure robust classification.

# Training
The ResNet50 model was trained using TensorFlow and Keras with an Adam optimizer. The training process involved data augmentation techniques to enhance model generalization. The training accuracy reached 90%, while the validation accuracy reached 88%.

# Evaluation
The model achieved an accuracy of 84.273% on the test dataset, highlighting its ability to accurately classify infant cry sounds. The model's precision, recall, and F1-score metrics are commendable.

# Usage
To use the trained ResNet50 model for inference, you can load the model weights using the provided script:


python load_resnet50_model.py --weights path/to/resnet50_weights.h5 --audio path/to/test_audio.wav
Replace path/to/resnet50_weights.h5 with the path to the saved model weights and path/to/test_audio.wav with the path to the audio file you want to classify.
